# SentinelApp

First draft of a phone app that will provide "dead man's switch"-style personal security.

- One the app is 'armed', the user must keep a hardware button pressed.
- If the user releases the button, the device immediately locks and sounds a siren at maximum volume.
- Only the user, by unlocking the phone, can disable the siren.
- Any thief or attacker cannot disable the siren, or lower its volume.
